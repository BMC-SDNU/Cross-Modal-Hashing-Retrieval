# Cross-Modal-Hashing-Retrieval
The baselines of cross-modal hashing retrieval.

## 1. Use

Each shallow method contains 'code/', 'result/' and 'train.sh'.

(1) **"code/"** The source codes folder.

(2) **"result/"** The result folder and the testing results will be recorded in file with the suffix of '.txt'.

(3) **"train.sh"** The training script. The 'dataname' and 'hash bits' will be changed here.
